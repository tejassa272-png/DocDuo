# 🚀 Hackathon Build Progress: Edge ML Pipeline & CDSS Integration

**Update Interval:** +21 Hours (Final Submission)  
**Current Version:** 5.0 (Final Release)  
**Core Tech Stack:** FastAPI, PyTorch/ONNX Runtime, OpenCV, Gemini 2.5 Flash, PyTesseract, HTML/CSS/JS (Glassmorphism UI)

## 🏗️ Architectural Milestones Achieved

* **Decoupled Database Architecture:** Successfully split the storage layer to ensure high performance. 
  * `hospital_database.json`: Handles lightweight, high-frequency queries (Auth, Triage Queues, Outbreak tracking).
  * `medical_records.json`: Dedicated heavy-storage container for decoupled patient history and base64 diagnostic images.
* **Frontend-Backend Data Binding:** Successfully finalized the data binding for the newly decoupled JSON payload structures, ensuring seamless clinical record syncing between the UI and the `medical_records.json` database.
* **Edge-AI Model Initialization (Complete):** Successfully exported PyTorch models to ONNX format and configured local inference sessions for all three primary vision tasks, ensuring absolute zero-cloud dependency:
  * ✅ `skincancer_efficientnet.onnx`
  * ✅ `braintumour_efficientnet.onnx`
  * ✅ `pneumonia_resnet18.onnx`
* **Computer Vision Pipeline:** Implemented `preprocess_image()` utilizing OpenCV for dynamic image decoding, RGB conversion, `224×224` resizing, and standard mean/std normalization for neural network ingestion.
* **Dynamic Admin Telemetry:** Integrated Leaflet.js with the backend to render a live, auto-purging epidemiological outbreak radar for geospatial disease tracking.
* **Enterprise UI/UX Polish:** Finalized the frontend HTML/CSS/JS. Implemented a premium "Glassmorphism" clinical theme, robust state management for triage workflows, and custom dynamic modals for severe Drug-Drug Interaction (DDI) alerts.
* **Highly Available (HA) Routing:** Built a multi-tier API fallback engine to guarantee 100% demo uptime, seamlessly routing between live cloud models and an offline "God Mode" safety net.

## 🔌 API Endpoints Implemented

### 1. Identity & Role Management (Auth)
* **`POST /auth/register-patient`**: Generates unique `PID-`, captures geolocation for outbreak tracking, and initializes decoupled medical records.
* **`POST /auth/register-doctor`**: Generates unique `DOC-` and secures registration with `HOSPITAL_ADMIN_SECRET`.
* **`POST /auth/login`**: Handles Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for `admin`, `patient`, and `doctor`. Dynamically enriches the doctor's waiting room queue with real-time triage statuses, and feeds aggregated geographic data to the Admin Outbreak Map.

### 2. Clinical Decision Support System (CDSS) & GenAI
* **`POST /doctor/check-ddi`**: Integrates Gemini 2.5 Flash to cross-reference new prescriptions against historical medication arrays for severe Drug-Drug Interactions (DDI).
* **`GET /doctor/trend/{patient_id}`**: Predictive longitudinal analytics. Extracts the last 3 decoupled medical records and prompts the LLM to generate predictive clinical trendlines.
* **`POST /doctor/save-patient-record`**: Captures diagnostic summaries, medications, and base64 images, appending them permanently to the decoupled `medical_records.json` and auto-closing active appointments.
* **`POST /chat/medical-assistant`**: Context-aware AI copilot providing real-time clinical consultation and decision support for attending physicians.
* **`POST /doctor/synthesize`**: Multimodal fusion engine that combines Vision AI results, Tesseract OCR blood data, and custom physician prompts to automate clinical synthesis and data cross-referencing.

### 3. Triage & Workflow Automation
* **`POST /emergency/sos`**: Escalates patient triage status to `Critical` in real-time.
* **`POST /appointments/book`**: Links patients to specific doctor queues and wakes up closed files.
* **`POST /patient/close-appointment`**: Restores patient autonomy by allowing them to dismiss completed appointments and reset their triage workflow to the closed state.

### 4. Edge Vision & Population Health
* **`POST /predict/dermatology`**: Runs the ONNX EfficientNet model on uploaded skin lesion images.
* **`POST /predict/brain-mri`**: Runs the ONNX EfficientNet model on uploaded brain MRI scans to classify tumor types.
* **`POST /predict/pneumonia`**: Runs the ONNX ResNet-18 model on Chest X-Rays. Integrates directly with the `admin` endpoint to map geographical infection zones.
* **`POST /analyze/blood-report`**: Local PyTesseract OCR pipeline utilizing OpenCV Adaptive Thresholding to ingest physical paper blood reports, structured via regex parser into strict JSON biomarker arrays.

## 🏁 Project Submission Prep (Completed)

* ✅ **Master `README.md` Written:** Documented the entire architecture, core features, and tech stack for the judges and open-source reviewers.
* ✅ **Deployment Instructions Finalized:** Wrote clear, step-by-step setup guides (including Python virtual environment setup, Tesseract OCR installation, and standard `uvicorn` run commands).
* ✅ **GitHub Repository Formatted:** Cleaned up the directory structure, added a `.gitignore` to keep out `__pycache__` and local `.env` variables, and pushed the final commits.
* ✅ **Pitch Deck Aligned:** Ensured the final presentation slides perfectly match the newly completed HA Routing, edge-vision pipeline, and UI workflows.
