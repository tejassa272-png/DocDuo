# 🚀 Hackathon Build Progress: Edge ML Pipeline & CDSS Integration

**Update Interval:** +9 Hours  
**Current Version:** 2.5  
**Core Tech Stack:** FastAPI, PyTorch/ONNX Runtime, OpenCV, Gemini 2.5 Flash, PyTesseract

## 🏗️ Architectural Milestones Achieved

* **Decoupled Database Architecture:** Successfully split the storage layer to ensure high performance. 
  * `hospital_database.json`: Handles lightweight, high-frequency queries (Auth, Triage Queues, Outbreak tracking).
  * `medical_records.json`: Dedicated heavy-storage container for decoupled patient history and base64 diagnostic images.
* **Frontend-Backend Data Binding:** Successfully finalized the data binding for the newly decoupled JSON payload structures, ensuring seamless clinical record syncing between the UI and the `medical_records.json` database.
* **Edge-AI Model Initialization (Complete):** Successfully exported PyTorch models to ONNX format and configured local inference sessions for all three primary vision tasks, ensuring absolute zero-cloud dependency:
  * ✅ `skincancer_efficientnet.onnx`
  * ✅ `braintumour_efficientnet.onnx`
  * ✅ `pneumonia_resnet18.onnx`
* **Computer Vision Pipeline:** Implemented `preprocess_image()` utilizing OpenCV for dynamic image decoding, RGB conversion, `224×224` resizing, and standard mean/std normalization for neural network ingestion.

## 🔌 API Endpoints Implemented

### 1. Identity & Role Management (Auth)
* **`POST /auth/register-patient`**: Generates unique `PID-`, captures geolocation for outbreak tracking, and initializes decoupled medical records.
* **`POST /auth/register-doctor`**: Generates unique `DOC-` and secures registration with `HOSPITAL_ADMIN_SECRET`.
* **`POST /auth/login`**: Handles Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for `admin`, `patient`, and `doctor`. Dynamically enriches the doctor's waiting room queue with real-time triage statuses.

### 2. Clinical Decision Support System (CDSS)
* **`POST /doctor/check-ddi`**: Integrates Gemini 2.5 Flash to cross-reference new prescriptions against historical medication arrays for severe Drug-Drug Interactions (DDI).
* **`GET /doctor/trend/{patient_id}`**: Predictive longitudinal analytics. Extracts the last 3 decoupled medical records and prompts the LLM to generate predictive clinical trendlines.
* **`POST /doctor/save-patient-record`**: Captures diagnostic summaries, medications, and base64 images, appending them permanently to the decoupled `medical_records.json`.

### 3. Triage & Workflow Automation
* **`POST /emergency/sos`**: Escalates patient triage status to `Critical` in real-time.
* **`POST /appointments/book`**: Links patients to specific doctor queues.
* **`POST /patient/close-appointment`**: Restores patient autonomy by allowing them to dismiss completed appointments and reset their triage workflow.

### 4. Edge Vision & Population Health
* **`POST /predict/dermatology`**: Runs the ONNX EfficientNet model on uploaded skin lesion images.
* **`POST /predict/brain-mri`**: Runs the ONNX EfficientNet model on uploaded brain MRI scans to classify tumor types.
* **`POST /predict/pneumonia`**: Runs the ONNX ResNet-18 model on Chest X-Rays. Integrates directly with the `admin` outbreak tracker to map geographical infection zones.
* **`POST /analyze/blood-report`**: Local PyTesseract OCR pipeline utilizing OpenCV Adaptive Thresholding to ingest physical paper blood reports, structured via LLM parser into strict JSON biomarker arrays.

## 🚧 Next 3-Hour Sprint / Enterprise Polish

* **Medical Assistant** Implementing `/chat/medical-assistant` for the doctor assistance.
* **Medical Assistant for report synthsis** Implementing `/doctor/synthesize` for the doctor assistance in prescription and summary using model results.
* **Admin Panel** Implementing `/auth/login"` for pneumonia analysis in particular area using maps and patient city.
